# Office-Access-Replace-Calendar-Control sample
Companion files for the Visual How To [*Replacing the Calendar Control in Access 2010 applications*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/gg251104%28v=office.14%29.aspx)

Microsoft Access has included a Calendar control since it first added support for ActiveX controls, in Access 2.0. The calendar control, MSCAL.OCX, is not included with Access 2010. In addition, if you attempt to open a form that includes the control, you will receive the following error: "Your Microsoft Office Access database or project contains a missing or broken reference to the file ꞌMSCAL.OCXꞌ."

This repostory is a companion to the Visual How To [*Replacing the Calendar Control in Access 2010 applications*](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/gg251104%28v=office.14%29.aspx). It contains an Access 2010 database that demonstrates replacing the calendar control and copy of the video showing how to replace the calendar control.

To see the sample calendar control:

1.  Clone the repostory to your local hard drive.
2.  Open the database file (CalendarDemo.accdb).
3.  Right-click on *frmCalendar* and select **Design view**.
4.  In the ribbon, select **View Code** to see the Visual Basic code that implements the calendar control.
