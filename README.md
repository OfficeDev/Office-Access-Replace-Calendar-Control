# Office-Access-Replace-Calendar-Control
Microsoft Access has included a Calendar control since it first added support for ActiveX controls, in Access 2.0. The calendar control, MSCAL.OCX, is not included with Access 2010. In addition, if you attempt to open a form that includes the control, you will receive the following error: "Your Microsoft Office Access database or project contains a missing or broken reference to the file ꞌMSCAL.OCXꞌ."
